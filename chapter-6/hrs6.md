# <span style="color: #1c6c8c; font-family: cambria">Chapter 6. Using the Website </span>

The HRS website is your portal to find out more about this complex study and to access and get started using the data. This section highlights particularly useful sections. 

### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria"> Documentation </span>
### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria"> Questionnaires </span>

VISIT THE WEBSITE: Documentation>Questionnaires 

A good place to start learning about the content of the survey is to look through the Questionnaires. These are printed representations of the interview sections. The top half of the questionnaire page shows the biennial core interview content by section across waves. You click on the section letter to view the questionnaire. Note that some questions are asked every second, third, or fourth waves, so-called Alternate Wave questions. Details are available in the Alternate Wave Questions Master Chart, which is linked at the top of the Questionnaire page. 

There are two main sections on the questionnaire page. The top half links to questionnaires associated with the biennial core interview by content section. Note that in some cases, the letter indicating each section has changed over the years. The bottom half of the page displays the off-year and health studies.  

Within the questionnaire, you can find information that is preloaded into the questionnaire at the beginning. For example, if you click on section C (Health) for 2020, in a panel interview, information about chronic conditions the respondent reported previously is preloaded into the interview.   

It is important to note that the questionnaire contains information describing the flow through the survey, including branch points. Examining the branch points will help you understand why some questions have a lower sample size than you might have expected. For example, only respondents who report having diabetes will be asked the follow-up question about the stage of their disease. You will also see at the top of the questionnaire that, as noted, exit interview questions appear in fuchsia or gray.  


### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria"> Codebooks </span>

VISIT THE WEBSITE: Documentation>Codebooks 

Every HRS data file has a codebook that provides frequency distributions on all variables in that data file. The codebook is organized by questionnaire section. Clicking on a particular section opens to another window. On the left is a listing of all of the variables in this section. On the right are the frequency distributions. The variable name on the left is a hyperlink to the frequency distribution for that variable. For example, clicking on Section C. Physical Health (respondent) for the 2020 Core, if we further scroll down to RC001, which is the variable name for self-rated health. The frequency distribution for that variable appears on the right (see Figure 6). This is also a good way to see the code frame for a particular question.

Note that if you find a variable in the codebook that has a much smaller sample than you might have expected, it is probably because of the skip patterns as noted above. Or it may be an alternate wave question, and you can consult the chart to find out if it is. 


### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria"> Data Descriptions </span>

VISIT THE WEBSITE: Documentation>Data Descriptions 

Each data product also has a data description associated with it. This is the most important documentation you can read for any HRS data product you want to use. The Data Description is your best source of information for understanding and using the associated data product. This Getting Started Guide covers some of the information you will find in the Tracker data description, but there is more detail and important information that is pertinent to each particular product.  

### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria"> User Guides and Documentation Reports </span>

VISIT THE WEBSITE: Documentation>User Guides and Documentation Reports 

User guides and documentation reports offer detailed information about the topics covered in the survey. They explain how the survey questions were created and where they came from. These guides are useful for researchers analyzing the survey data because they go beyond basic codebooks and questionnaires. They give detailed explanations of the survey questions, how variables have changed over time, statistical summaries of the responses, analyses of the quality of the data, details about how each survey is organized, and guidance on how to handle the data in special cases. 


### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria"> Survey Design and Methodology </span>

VISIT THE WEBSITE: Documentation> Survey Design and Methodology 

The data collection table on the Survey Design and Methodology link (see Figure 7) shows the history of HRS data collection efforts, with links to additional information about each data product. For cross-year products, the table shows which years are included in the release. All acronyms in the table are spelled out at the top. Then for each year below, you can see the biennial, off-year, sensitive health, restricted data, and derived data products. Each of these buttons takes you to an overview information page about that data product.

The Survey Design and Methodology page also provides documentation related to incentive token amounts, sample sizes and response rates, weigh information, survey design, and imputations. 


### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria"> Concordance </span>

VISIT THE WEBSITE: Documentation>Concordance 

Concordance is a question search tool that helps you quickly see which questions are in which waves. Type what you’re looking for in the search box. Use quotation marks to search this exact phrase. There are filters for the type of variable and for the wave. For example, in Figure 8, we have typed C001, which is the variable name for self-rated health. The search returns a table that displays the wave, variable name, label, question text, and a cross-wave equivalents (xref).  Clicking on the variable name will take you to the codebook entry for that item.  You could also search for a phrase, like “self-rated health.” 

The cross-wave equivalents or cross reference (xref) is a feature that helps users find out if a specific variable from the survey data is available in other survey waves and under what names. This can be very useful, but it's not entirely accurate, particularly for earlier waves of data. The way variables were named was a bit inconsistent in the past but became more standardized from the year 2000 onwards. So, when looking at variable information from earlier surveys, like those from 1992 and 1994, be cautious. For instance, although self-rated health information exists in those years, they might not show up in the xref feature.

### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria"> DATA PRODUCTS </span>

On the data products page, you'll find links sorted into three groups based on the type of data: public, sensitive health, and restricted. For the public and sensitive health categories, clicking a link for a specific data file will bring you to a page with more details about that file. At the top of this page, there is an overview that includes the release date and version of the file, the number of respondents and households included, which groups of participants are in the file, when the data was gathered, any important notices about the data, and links to related documents like the data description, questionnaire, and codebook. If you haven't signed in, you'll only be able to see this general information. However, once you log in, you'll also see the actual data files available for download below the documentation section (see Figure 9)

### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria"> Data alerts </span>

Data alerts are notices of errors, corrections, or problems in HRS early and final public data releases and associated documentation. 

### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria"> MEDIA & PUBLICATIONS </span>
### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria"> Online bibliography </span>

HRS keeps track of research publications that use its data. Researchers agree to inform HRS about their publications as part of the conditions for using the data. The HRS team also proactively looks through publication databases to add to their bibliography of research. 

The bibliography page shows the total number of related publications and offers options to download the list in different formats, like RTF for Word. You can sort the bibliography by the first author's last name, title, type of publication, and year. There's a search box for more specific queries, and options to filter the search by publication type, year, and keywords. 

As you search, the number of entries that match your criteria will be updated, and you can download these results as an RTF file. Each listed publication includes a link to PubMed or Google Scholar, which often gives you access to the full-text paper. This resource is beneficial for seeing how others have used HRS data and for generating your own research ideas.
