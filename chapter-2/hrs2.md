### <span style="color: #147ca4; font-family: cambria">HRS MULTISTAGE COMPLEX DESIGN</span>

To draw a nationally representative sample of the US population over age 50, HRS employs a
complex sample design with two main design features: stratification and clustering. Figure 2
depicts a basic multistage design.

In a national sample, the process involves multiple steps: initially, large areas called primary sampling units (PSUs), typically counties, are selected. Then, within these PSUs, smaller areas like cities or towns called secondary sampling units (SSUs) are chosen (strata). Next, specific sections of homes (clusters) are picked, and finally, individuals within those homes are selected for interviews.

The HRS sample is based on a multi-stage, area-clustered, stratified sample design. It consistently separates large primary sampling units (PSUs), like major cities, which are always included, from smaller PSUs, chosen based on their population size. This ensures that denser areas are more likely to be selected. PSUs are typically big cities or combined counties.

This sample design includes a deliberate oversampling of Hispanic and African American households. This method increases their numbers in the HRS to allow for more accurate analysis and comparisons within these racial/ethnic groups.

The HRS focuses on the U.S. population over 50 who do not live in institutions. People in the study who move into nursing homes after joining are still interviewed every two years, making the sample representative of older adults both at home and in nursing facilities post-enrollment.

The HRS sample design results in varied selection chances for participants, so using sampling weights is crucial to avoid bias when making generalizations about the U.S. population. Standard methods for estimating variance don't work well due to the sample's specific geographic organization, and corrections using design variables are necessary. Chapter 8 gives instructions on how to properly use these weights and design variables in analysis.

A video tutorial is available that reviews these concepts in detail.
