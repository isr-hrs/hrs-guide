<div class="hrs-text">
The University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of Americans over the age of 50.  Supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Social Security Administration (SSA), HRS is designed to provide reliable data on the decisions, choices, and behaviors of people as they age and respond to changes in public policy, the economy, and health. Since 1992, the biennial survey has interviewed more than 43,000 individuals. The core survey focuses on income and wealth, health and use of health services, employment, and family connection. In 2006, data collection expanded to biomarkers, genetics, and a range of information on psychological states and social contexts. The data are linked at the individual level to administrative records from the Social Security Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service, the Veteranâ€™s Administration, and the 1940 Decennial Census as well as contextual data on state policies, environmental conditions, and food access. At the employer level, they are linked to employer-provided pension plan information. There are three levels of data access: public, sensitive, and restricted. Public data are available to all registered users. Sensitive and restricted data require special permission. The website is your portal to find out more about the study and to access the data. This Guide is intended to help new users get started using the data.
